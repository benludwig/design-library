## Pattern Lab Node with SASS to CSS Preprocessing as a Gulp Task

By default, the Node version of Pattern Lab doesnâ€™t include CSS preprocessing. It is intentionally excluded due to the number of different workflows and tools for working with SASS. This version includes a Gulp task that processes SASS to CSS in source and public folders in parallel with BrowserSync.

## Prerequisites

[Node](https://nodejs.org) for core processing, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage project dependencies, and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) to run tasks and interface with the core library. Installation of Node will include npm. It's also highly recommended to install gulp globally.

## Up and Running with Mac Terminal

```
git clone [this repository]
cd [root directory]
npm install
npm install gulp-sass
gulp patternlab:build
gulp patternlab:serve
```

## Manually Reproduce

To recreate this packaged repository, clone the Node Edition straight from Pattern Lab, add all standard modules, install gulp-sass and replace gulp.js.
